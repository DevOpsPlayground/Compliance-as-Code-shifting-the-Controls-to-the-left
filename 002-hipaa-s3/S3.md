# S3 Information 

S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a way of storing data in the form objects. 

Objects are collected into buckets.

## What is versioning?

## What is an ACL?

Amazon S3 access control lists (ACLs) enable you to manage access to buckets and objects. Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a subresource. It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. When a request is received against a resource, Amazon S3 checks the corresponding ACL to verify that the requester has the necessary access permissions.

ACLs are used to determine who can access the objects within an S3 bucket. ACLs support complex implementations, however there are some canned ACLs which can be used by all S3 buckets.

### Canned ACLs

| Canned ACL                | Applies to        | Permissions added to ACL                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| private                   | Bucket and object | Owner gets FULL\_CONTROL. No one else has access rights (default).                                                                                                                                                                      |
| public-read               | Bucket and object | [Owner gets FULL\_CONTROL. The AllUsers group (see Who is a grantee?) gets READ access.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#specifying-grantee)                                                    |
| public-read-write         | Bucket and object | Owner gets FULL\_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access. Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.                                                                                                        |
| aws-exec-read             | Bucket and object | Owner gets FULL\_CONTROL. Amazon EC2 gets READ access to GET an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) bundle from Amazon S3.                                                                                                                       |
| authenticated-read        | Bucket and object | Owner gets FULL\_CONTROL. The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.                                                                                                                                                                |
| bucket-owner-read         | Object            | Object owner gets FULL\_CONTROL. Bucket owner gets READ access. If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.                                                                                            |
| bucket-owner-full-control | Object            | Both the object owner and the bucket owner get FULL\_CONTROL over the object. If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.                                                                              |
| log-delivery-write        | Bucket            | [The LogDelivery group gets WRITE and READ\_ACP permissions on the bucket. For more information about logs, see (Logging requests using server access logging).](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html) |

We will use the `private` ACL, to ensure that by default nobody has access to our S3 bucket but ourselves.
